Review the files in the `projects/` directory and identify opportunities for improvement. Focus on:

1. **Documentation Quality**: Ensure project files are well-documented with clear goals, progress tracking, and implementation details.

2. **Project Status**: Update any outdated status information, mark completed tasks, and identify next steps.

3. **Technical Accuracy**: Verify that technical specifications and implementation plans are accurate and up-to-date.

4. **Organization**: Improve file structure, formatting, and cross-references between related projects.

**Guidelines:**
- Only make improvements to existing projects, don't create new ones unless explicitly needed
- Focus on incremental improvements rather than major rewrites
- Ensure any changes maintain the original project intent and goals
- Update progress status accurately based on current codebase state

**Safety Notes:**
- Do not modify core project goals without clear justification
- Preserve all existing implementation work and progress tracking
- Only update documentation and organizational elements
