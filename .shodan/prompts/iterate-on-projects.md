Review the files in the `projects/` directory and identify a single, scoped iterative task to drive one of the projects forward. In addition, review the current active open PRs. Bias towards projects that do not have active working happening.

If a project has active work happening, make sure to create your branch off of the existing work and open a PR with the existing work as a base. If there are multiple PRs for a project, base your branch off the latest one.

**Guidelines:**

- Only make improvements to existing projects, don't create new ones unless explicitly needed
- Focus on incremental work to implement the plan
- Ensure any changes maintain the original project intent and goals
- Update progress status accurately based on current codebase state

**Safety Notes:**

- Do not modify core project goals without clear justification
- Preserve all existing implementation work and progress tracking
- Only update documentation and organizational elements
