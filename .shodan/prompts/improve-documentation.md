Review and improve the project's documentation to make it more helpful for developers and users. Focus on:

1. **README Updates**: Enhance the main README.md with:
   - Clear project description and goals
   - Updated build instructions
   - Current feature status
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Troubleshooting sections

2. **Code Documentation**: Improve inline documentation:
   - Add missing function/struct documentation
   - Clarify complex algorithms or VR-specific code
   - Document public APIs and their usage
   - Add examples for non-obvious functionality

3. **Developer Guides**: Create or update development documentation:
   - Setup instructions for new developers
   - Architecture overview documents
   - VR development guidelines specific to this project
   - Testing and debugging guides

4. **Project Documentation**: Maintain project-specific docs:
   - Update DEVELOPMENT.md with current practices
   - Document any new build requirements or dependencies
   - Keep CLAUDE.md updated with development guidelines
   - Update reference documentation as needed

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on accuracy and helpfulness over completeness
- Use clear, concise language that's accessible to new contributors
- Include practical examples where helpful
- Ensure all code examples are tested and working

**Safety Notes:**
- Do not modify functional code while adding documentation
- Verify that documented APIs and examples are correct
- Do not make assumptions about features not yet implemented
- Keep documentation aligned with actual codebase state
